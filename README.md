The Online Supermarket Project built using Python and Flask consists of four modules: Admin, User, Delivery Boy, and Shops. The Admin manages the entire system, including users, products, shops, and deliveries. The User module allows customers to register, browse products, place orders, and track their purchases. The Delivery Boy module enables delivery personnel to view assigned orders, update delivery statuses, and manage their tasks. The Shops module lets shop owners manage their product listings, handle packaging for orders. Together, these modules ensure a seamless shopping experience with efficient product management and delivery coordination.
